# Employee-Burnout-Prediction
This project aims to predict employee burnout by analyzing various factors such as workload, job satisfaction, emotional well-being, and work-life balance. By utilizing machine learning and data analysis techniques, the goal is to identify early signs of burnout and provide actionable insights that can help improve employee well-being and productivity. The project includes data collection from employee surveys, the development of predictive models, and real-time monitoring of key indicators like performance decline, absenteeism, and emotional symptoms. The solution is built using Python, with libraries such as Scikit-learn for machine learning, Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing results. Companies can use this tool to assess burnout risks, take preventative measures, and support their employees' mental and emotional health, thereby enhancing overall workplace performance
